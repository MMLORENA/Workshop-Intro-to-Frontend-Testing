# Hands-on: Write Your First Frontend Test

## Introduction

_WelcomeðŸ¤©!_

This workshop is designed to be dynamic and participatory, where we can discuss, share experiences, and solve doubts
together.

In addition to the theoretical part, we will dedicate time to practice what we have learned through **mini katas**
specifically designed to reinforce the concepts we discuss.

Let's get started! ðŸš€

I hope you enjoy the workshop as much as I enjoyed preparing it.
